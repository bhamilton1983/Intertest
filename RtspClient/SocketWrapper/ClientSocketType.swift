        // calling `connect()` a second time. `ClientSocketType` could then be a subtype of `AddressSocketType`
        // only (without `SendReceiveSocketType`), meaning that you'd first have to create a `ClientSocketType`
        // and call `connect()` on it to get back a new `ConnectedClientSocketType` which would then be the only
        // one to be able to `send()` and `receive()`. This would also have the nice effect that a socket couldn't
        // `send()` or `receive()` before being `connect()`ed.
        //
        // There are some issues with that approach, though:
        //  - A mechanism similar to `ServerSocketType.accept()` would be necessary to allow callers to decide
        //    which concrete adopter of `ConnectedClientSocketType` should be used. This is a bit cumbersome for 
        //    something that isn't strictly necessary here.
        //  - `self` and the newly created socket would share the same underlying file descriptor, making it
        //    unclear for the callsite to decide which one should `close()` the socket.
